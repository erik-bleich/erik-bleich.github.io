        <p>The Media Portrayals of Minorities Project lab was launched at Middlebury College in 2012. It has directly involved undergraduate students in research by training them in lab techniques. MPoMP lab members develop projects, are co-presenters of research at academic conferences, and are co-authors on published scholarship. They are also encouraged to write senior theses using lab procedures.</p>
