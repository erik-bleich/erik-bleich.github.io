        <p>The Media Portrayals of Minorities Project produces periodic reports that compare media coverage of different groups. Our first report examines five prominent racial, ethnic, and religious groups in the United States in 2018. It identifies the amount and tone of coverage associated with each group, trends over a five-year time period, and the most prominent themes in stories about these groups.</p>
